I developed a blog website using the MERN stack, focused on sharing coding research and insights. The platform integrates custom APIs, though there is some delay in response time due to deployment on a free Render instance. Despite this, the website remains a valuable resource for documenting and sharing technical content. The site is live and showcases a variety of coding-related topics.
